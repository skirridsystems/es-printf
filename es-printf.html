<h2 id="whatis">What is es-printf?</h2>
<p>
    es-printf is an implementation of the standard C printf function targetted
    at small embedded systems. It provides several advantages over the
    standard function:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
    There are many fine-grained customisations which allow you to trim
    the size to absolute minimum so it will fit in limited code space.
    You can elect to have only hexadecimal output, full floating point support
    and any number of options in between.
</li>
<li>
    It does not use any static buffers so it is thread-safe and can
    safely be used within interrupts and in an RTOS environment.
</li>
<li>
    You provide your own output function which can be to a serial port
    or to anything else convenient.
</li>
<li>
    Because the source code is available it is easy to extend the
    formatter to provide custom specifiers for your particular needs.
</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="format">Supported formatting commands</h2>
<p>
    The format argument is a C string that contains the text to be written to output.
    It can optionally contain embedded format specifiers that are replaced by the values
    specified in subsequent additional arguments and formatted as requested.
</p>
<p>
    A format specifier follows this prototype:<br />
    %[flags][width][.precision][length]specifier

    <tr><td>#</td><td>Used with o, b, x or X specifiers the value is preceeded with 0, 0b, 0x or 0X
            respectively.<br />
            Used with e, E, f, g or G it forces the output to contain a decimal point even if
            no more digits follow. By default, if no digits follow, no decimal point is written.</td></tr>

            even if the result is longer. A precision of 0 means that no character is written
            for the value 0.<br />

<!-- ************************************************************************************ -->
<!-- ************************************************************************************ -->

<p class="right"><a href="#top">Top</a></p>
<h2 id="config">Configuration</h2>
<p>
    Configuration takes place in two separate files.
    <i>printf_cfg.h</i> is included only by printf.c itself.
    <i>printf.h</i> is included by printf.c and by consumers of printf family functions.
</p>

<h3>printf_cfg.h</h3>
<p>
    This file defines the feature set supported and it is included only by printf.c
    itself. The purpose of this file is to separate the configuration from the code
    itself as much as possible. In normal use the code in printf.c will not need to
    be changed at all.
</p>
<h4>#define BASIC_PRINTF_ONLY</h4>
<p>
    The code is designed to support a variety of printf-related functions.
    If simple serial output is all you want then you can save some space by
    defining BASIC_PRINTF_ONLY which allows the internal API to be simplified.
    Note that sprintf will not be supported in this case.
</p>
<h4 id="get_format">#define GET_FORMAT(ptr)</h4>
<p>
    The GET_FORMAT(ptr) macro is used to access a character in the printf
    format string. By default this does a normal memory pointer access, but
    you can configure it to call an accessor function if needed.
</p>
<p>
    This behaviour is required for the GCC AVR compiler when the format string
    has been placed in flash using the technique described below under printf.h.
    For many micros this will not be required and can be left commented out.
</p>
<h4>#define PUTCHAR_FUNC</h4>
<p>
    By default printf will use the putchar function t ohandle its output. If this
    is not defined in your system, or if you wish to specify a different function,
    you can set your own function here by defining PUTCHAR_FUNC to be the name of
    that function. The function should expect a single char argument and need not
    return a value.
</p>
<h4>#define NO_DOUBLE_PRECISION</h4>
<p>
    Some compilers do not support double precision and silently degrade to
    single precision. If this is the case then the floating point formatting
    can be reduced a little using this option, rather than try to handle data
    which does not actually exist.
</p>
<h4>#define NO_ISNAN_ISINF</h4>
<p>
    Some compilers do not support the isnan and isinf floating point functions
    to detect the not-a-number and infinity special cases. If this option is
    defined then those tests are simply ignored and the output for those values
    is indeterminate.
</p>

<h4>typedef width_t</h4>
<p>
    Since it is extremely unlikely that you will ever want to use a formatted
    width for a single item of more than 127 chars (i.e. the expanded and
    padded size of a single % expression), the width variables can normally
    be restricted to 8 bits. On small micros this saves a lot of code and
    variable space. On a 32-bit RISC it may increase code size due to type
    conversions. Choose the variable type to suit your CPU.
    Note that a signed type is required.
</p>

<h4>Feature configuration</h4>
<p>
    You can enable and disable features at a fine-grained level, allowing
    you to provide only the features you need and control the code size.
    Define as non-zero to enable, zero to disable.
</p>
<table>
    <tr><th>Define</th><th>Description</th></tr>
    <tr><td>USE_FLOAT</td><td>Include floating point support.
            Most of the time you will not need this and it adds considerable weight
            to the code as well as pulling in the floating point libraries.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>USE_LONG</td><td>Include support for long integers. Often not needed for
            embedded applications. If you are happy using hex output you can also
            print longs by splitting into two shorts.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>USE_OCTAL</td><td>Traditionally printf supports octal output but you very
            rarely see it used, so why waste the code space?</td></tr>
    <tr><td>USE_BINARY</td><td>An extension to printf to use %b for binary output.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>USE_SIGNED</td><td>Supports %d for signed decimal output.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>USE_SIGNED_I</td><td>Supports %i as a synonym for %d. Omitting this doesn't
            save a lot, but every little helps.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>USE_UNSIGNED</td><td>Supports %u for unsigned decimal output. In many cases
            %d is good enough on its own.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>USE_HEX_LOWER</td><td>Supports %x (lowercase hex output).</td></tr>
    <tr><td>USE_HEX_UPPER</td><td>Supports %X (uppercase hex output).</td></tr>
    <tr><td>USE_HEX_UPPER_L</td><td>In conjunction with %x, if you decide you want all output to
            be uppercase instead you can include this option instead of changing all the format strings.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>USE_CHAR</td><td>Supports %c for single character output.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>USE_STRING</td><td>Supports %s for string output.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>USE_FSTRING</td><td>Supports %S for string output where the string is embedded in flash.
            This option is only useful in micros such as the AVR where strings in flash
            require different memory access methods.
            The <a href="#get_format">GET_FORMAT</a> macro is used to access the string in this case.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>USE_PRECISION</td><td>Include <a href="#precision">precision</a> support when floating point is not present.
            Precision is automatically enabled when floating point support is used.
            For integer work it is not very useful, though strings sometime use it.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>USE_ZERO_PAD</td><td>Allow use of the field widths with leading zero padding e.g. %03d.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>USE_SPACE_PAD</td><td>Allow use of fields widths with space padding, e.g. %3d or %12s</td></tr>
    <tr><td>USE_INDIRECT</td><td>Include indirect width/precision support, e.g. %*d.
            I don't think I have ever used this.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>USE_PLUS_SIGN</td><td>Allow use of the <a href="#flags">plus flag</a> e.g. %+d.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>USE_SPACE_SIGN</td><td>Allow use of the <a href="#flags">space flag</a> e.g. % d.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>USE_LEFT_JUST</td><td>Allow use of the <a href="#flags">left-justify flag</a> e.g. %-12s.</td></tr>

</table>

<h4>Pre-defined feature groups</h4>
<p>
    Most of the time you can use one of the pre-defined configs which give sensible
    sets of options.

<h3>printf.h</h3>
<p>
    This file defines the way printf() is called and the value it returns.
</p>
<h4>#define PRINTF_T</h4>
<p>
    Traditionally printf returns the number of chars output. If you are not interested
    in that value you can leave PRINTF_T undefined, which eliminates the code required
    to count characters output.
</p>
<p>
    On a small micro you can often define the return type as unsigned char since it
    in most use cases the output will never exceed 255 characters. This allows an 8-bit
    variable to be used for character counting, saving code space. Alternatively you
    can use unsigned short or simply int.
</p>

<h4>#define printf</h4>
<p>
    Some devices, notably the GCC AVR compiler, need some trickery here to get the
    format strings to reside in flash memory rather than RAM, requiring the string
    to be wrapped in a macro. To make this transparent we can define the printf
    function itself as a macro which performs the wrap and calls a renamed version
    of printf with a _rom suffix.
</p>
<p>
    The header supplied shows how to do this for AVR. For many other micros this will
    not be required and can be left commented out.

<h2 id="integrate">Integration</h2>
<p>
    You need to add these three source files to your project: printf.c printf.h printf_cfg.h.
    Unless you need to add or modify features you will not need to edit printf.c at all.
    Go through printf.h and pick the options to suit your environment. If you don't need
    any oddball ways of getting quoted strings into flash memory then there is not a lot
    to do here and the defaults will work fine.
</p>
<p>
    Go through printf_cfg.h and select the options you want. As a minimum you will
    need to set the output function, unless you already have a function called putchar which
    does what you want. You'll also need to select which feature set you want. Pick one of the
    pre-defined groups to start with.
</p>
<p>
    In the source files where you want to call printf you will need to explicitly #include
    printf.h as the prototypes may be different from what comes in stdio.h with your compiler.
    Build your project and hopefully everything will just work.

<h2 id="test">Test code</h2>
<p>
    The test code provided is mainly for development use to allow the code to be checked.
    If you are just integrating es-printf into your own application you won't need this part.
    It does several things.
</p>
<ol>
    <li>It produces an executable to run on PC or
    Linux (only tested on PC) which uses both the standard printf and this version
    so that the output can be compared for equivalent behaviour.</li>
    <li>It generates a hex file for AVR using Win-AVR so the test code can be run on a real
    embedded system.</li>
    <li>It generates AVR elf files with and without printf linked so we can see
    exactly how much code space is taken for any given set of options.</li>
    <li>It generates a hex file for STM8 using the Raisonance compiler. This is to validate
    the code on another very different 8-bit architecture.</li>
</ol>
<p>
    The PC test code uses the gcc compiler which is assumed to be in the default path.
</p>
<p>
    The AVR test code uses WinAVR-20100110 compiler which is assumed to be at its default
    installation location. More recent versions are shipped as part of Atmel Studio and
    are located in the Program Files directory. You would need to adjust the paths in the
    makefile to cope with this.
</p>
<p>
    The STM8 test code is built using the Raisonance Ride7 IDE. You need to load the .rprj
    file and build it.

<p class="right"><a href="#top">Top</a></p>
<h2 id="size">AVR Code Size</h2>
<p>
    The table below shows the approximate code size of the printf function for an 8-bit AVR,
    using some of the pre-defined feature groups.
</p>
<p>
    The size is derived by comparing a build with a single call to printf and an empty format
    string to a build without that call. For real-world use you will need to add the overhead
    of making real calls to printf, which includes the length of the format string itself and
    the overhead of pushing the values onto the stack.
</p>
<p>
    All values were checked using WinAVR-20100110 with no return value from printf,
    except where stated.
</p>
<p>
    The floating point figure also covers the size of floating point libraries.
    If you are using the floating point version of printf then presumably you
    are already using floating point in your code anyway, so some of those libraries
    will already be in your code. A similar argument applies to long integer support.
