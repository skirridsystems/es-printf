Version 1.0 - 26 Jun 2015
First public release on Sourceforge. Code previously residing on googlecode
had never been formally released.

The original basic integer version had been in use for over 10 years when
es-printf was started. It lacked many formatting options and floating point
support, and it was not configurable. es-printf was developed to offer
the full functionality of the standard printf function, but with full
configurability, optimisation for small micros, and thread-safe operation.
